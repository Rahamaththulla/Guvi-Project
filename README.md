How to scrape the Twitter Data?

    Scraping can be done with the help of many opensource libraries like
          1.Tweepy
          2.Twint
          3.Snscrape
          4.Getoldtweet3
     For my project I have used SNSCRAPE library.     
     
Libraries and Modules needed for the project
 
        1.snscrape.modules.twitter - (To Scrape the Data from Twitter)
        2.Pandas - (To Create a DataFrame with the scraped data)
        3.Pymongo - (To upload the dataframe to MongoDB database)

Snscrape

         Snscrape allows you to scrape basic information such as a user's profile, tweet content, source, and so on. Snscrape is not limited to Twitter, but can also scrape content from other prominent social media networks like Facebook, Instagram, and others.
         
Streamlit


           Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc. Streamlit allows you to re-use any Python code you have already written. This can save considerable amounts of time compared to non-Python based tools where all code to create visualizations needs to be re-written.  In my project I've extensively used streamlit API Reference feature for creation of Titles, Images, Headers, Input boxes, Buttons, Checkbox, Download buttons.
